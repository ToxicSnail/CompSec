# C
Labs on programming language C

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1 semester:

sort.c - This program is execute algorithm, which maximum digit reduce on 2 and minimum increase on 2 too.

Lab_5.1.c - Form a number V in which the digits of a given natural number N are in reverse order. For example, if N = 123, then the number V = 321.

Lab_5.2.c - Calculate with the help of a series the value of the function with an accuracy of |EPS|<1; compare the value obtained with the value of the corresponding standard function.
  //cos(x) = 1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - x^6/6! + ... +(-1)^n × x^2n /(2n)! + …

Lab_6.1.c - Rearrange the elements of the array X so that negative elements come first, then zeros, then positive elements, while maintaining the order of the elements in each of these groups.

Lab_6.2.c - Given arrays X and Y, each of which has no repeating elements. Construct an array Z - the intersection of X and Y.

Lab_6.3.c - Given arrays of integers X and Y. Construct an ordered array Z by merging arrays X and Y.

bool_arr_prime_num.c - Using a boolean array, find all prime numbers up to the number you entered.

2 semester:

realise_nam.c - Implementation of the Markov Algorithm (NAM) in C.

sort_with_different_sorts.c - Understand which of the sorting algorithms is the most "high-speed". We have bubble, direct insertion, and direct selection sorts.

coding_decoding_files.c - Perform encoding of a given text file, using the modulo two operation, with a given key, decoding a text file, comparing two text files for equality.

search_in_bool_vector.c - Finding the same values in an array using bitwise operations on vectors.

sort_surnames.c - Sort string values with removal of duplicate strings.

operations on a boolean vector.c - Implement all the proposed operations for a Boolean vector of arbitrary length: Boolean multiplication, Boolean addition, Modulo 2 sum, Invert, Shift left by K bits, Shift right by K bits, Set/reset Kth bit, Function to convert string to boolean vector, A function to convert a boolean vector to a string.

realise stek + polis.c - It is required to implement a function that checks the expression for correctness. The algorithm is based on the use of a stack.

uniq_elem.c - counts the number of unique elements
